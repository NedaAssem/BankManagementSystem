# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++ Console Project)

This project represents the early stage of my software development journey.  
I built the **Bank Management System** twice — first using **Functional Programming**,  
and then restructured it using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to improve design and code organization.

## 📘 About the Project

The goal of this project is to simulate a simple bank management system  
where users can:
- Create an account  
- Deposit and withdraw money  
- Check account balance  

I created this project using **C++** as a **console application** during my learning period.

- Implemented with basic **C++ functions**  
- Focused on **logic, input/output, and procedural structure**  
- No classes or objects — just step-by-step execution  

### 2️⃣ Object-Oriented Version – `/oop/`
- Refactored using **C++ classes** and **OOP principles**:
  - Classes & Objects  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Inheritance  
  - Polymorphism  
- Improved maintainability and flexibility of the code
