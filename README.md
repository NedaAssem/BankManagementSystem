# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++ Console Project)

This project represents an important stage of my software development journey.  
I built the **Bank Management System** twice — first using **Functional Programming**,  
and then refactored it using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to improve the structure and design.

## 📘 About the Project

The goal of this project is to simulate a **banking system** where users can register, log in, and perform banking operations securely.

I built this using **C++** as a **console application**, and it includes role-based permissions and account management features.

## 💡 Main Features

- **User Registration** – New users can create accounts.  
- **User Login System** – Registered users can log in securely.  
- **Permissions & Roles:**  
  - Admin users: manage clients and transactions  
  - Client users: check balances, deposit, withdraw  
- **Account Management:**  
  Create, view, and update bank accounts  
- **Console Interface:**  
  Simple text-based interface for user interaction
