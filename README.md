# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++ Console Project)

A simple **console-based Bank Management System** built with C++ to simulate basic banking operations like   
user registration, login, account management, and transactions.   
This project demonstrates my learning progress — from **functional programming** to **object-oriented   
programming (OOP)** — using clean, structured code.

## 💡 Main Features

- **User Registration:**  
  New users can create their own accounts.

- **User Login System:**  
  Only registered users can log in with their credentials.

- **Permissions & Roles:**  
  - **Admin users** can manage clients, approve transactions, and control user permissions.  
  - **Client users** can check balances, deposit, and withdraw funds.

- **Account Management:**  
  - Create and manage bank accounts  
  - Deposit and withdraw money  
  - View account balance and transaction history  

- **Console Interface:**  
  Simple, text-based interface for easy navigation.

## 🧩 Versions

### 1️⃣ Functional Version – `/functional/`
- Implemented using **C++ functions** only  
- Focused on procedural programming, logic, and console I/O  
- Step-by-step implementation with no classes  

### 2️⃣ Object-Oriented Version – `/oop/`
- Refactored using **C++ classes** and **OOP principles**, including:  
  - Classes & Objects  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Inheritance  
  - Polymorphism  
- Cleaner, more maintainable, and modular design

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

- Through this project, I learned to:

- Build real-world applications using C++ console programming

- Design and implement user login and permission systems

- Understand the difference between functional and OOP design

- Write clean, reusable, and maintainable C++ code

---


## ✨ Future Improvements

- Improve security for user login (password hashing)

- Add Transaction History storage

- Extend features with more banking operations

- Migrate to GUI (C# Windows Forms or Web API)
