# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++ Console Project)

This project represents an important stage of my software development journey.  
I built the **Bank Management System** twice — first using **Functional Programming**,  
and then refactored it using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to improve the structure and design.

## 📘 About the Project

The goal of this project is to simulate a **banking system** where users can register, log in, and perform banking operations securely.

I built this using **C++** as a **console application**, and it includes role-based permissions and account management features.

## 💡 Main Features

- **User Registration:**  
  New users can create their own accounts.

- **User Login System:**  
  Only registered users can log in with their credentials.

- **Permissions & Roles:**  
  - **Admin users** can manage clients, approve transactions, and control user permissions.  
  - **Client users** can check balances, deposit, and withdraw funds.

- **Account Management:**  
  - Create and manage bank accounts  
  - Deposit and withdraw money  
  - View account balance and transaction history  

- **Console Interface:**  
  Simple, text-based interface for easy navigation.

=======
### 1️⃣ Functional Version – `/functional/`
- Implemented using **C++ functions** only  
- Focused on procedural programming, logic, and console I/O  
- Step-by-step implementation with no classes  

### 2️⃣ Object-Oriented Version – `/oop/`
- Refactored using **C++ classes** and **OOP principles**, including:  
  - Classes & Objects  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Inheritance  
  - Polymorphism  
- Cleaner, more maintainable, and modular design
