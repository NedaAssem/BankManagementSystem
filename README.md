# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++ Console Project)

A simple **console-based Bank Management System** built with C++ to simulate basic banking operations like 
user registration, login, account management, and transactions.
This project demonstrates my learning progress — from **functional programming** to **object-oriented 
programming (OOP)** — using clean, structured code.
