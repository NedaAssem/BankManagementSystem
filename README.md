# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++ Console Project)

A simple **console-based Bank Management System** built with C++ to simulate basic banking operations like   
user registration, login, account management, and transactions.   
This project demonstrates my learning progress — from **functional programming** to **object-oriented   
programming (OOP)** — using clean, structured code.

## 💡 Features

✅ User Registration and Login.  
✅ User Roles and Permissions (Admin / Normal User).   
✅ Deposit and Withdraw Money.   
✅ View Account Details.   
✅ Manage Multiple Users.  
✅ Console-based UI (text menus).

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Functional programming (first version)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling
- Loops, Conditionals, and Functions
- Classes, Objects, and Encapsulation
