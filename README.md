# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++ Console Project)

This project represents an important stage of my software development journey.  
I built the **Bank Management System** twice — first using **Functional Programming**,  
and then refactored it using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to improve the structure and design.

## 📘 About the Project

A simple **console-based Bank Management System** built with C++ to simulate basic banking operations like user registration, login, account management, and transactions.

This project demonstrates my learning progress — from **functional programming** to **object-oriented programming (OOP)** — using clean, structured code.
